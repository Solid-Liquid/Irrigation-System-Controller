# Irrigation-System-Controller
2019 Senior Design Project, CSUN
Irrigation System Project, Hardware Team

Team Members: Ian Hinze, Marvin Mallari, Christian Martinez, Daniel Stein, Froilan Campos, Varun Ganesh

Award-winning team project with the goal of creating a low-energy, low-cost irrigation system controller
with Raspberry PI and STM boards. The award was for best computer science presentation at the
CSUN Senior Design Project Showcase (2019). 

This repository is a code dump for the work done by the embedded hardware team. This side of the project involves communication between a Raspberry PI board and an STM baord. The PI code was written in Python directly on a Raspberry PI system. The STM code was written in C++ on the Arduino IDE. 

Relevant documentation is the the documentation folder.
